This constraint indicates to the compositor that a content\nupdate should be presented as closely as possible to, but not before,\na specified time.\n\nThis protocol does not change the Wayland property that content\nupdates are applied in the order they are received, even when some\ncontent updates contain timestamps and others do not.\n\nTo provide timestamps, this global factory interface must be used to\nacquire a wp_commit_timing_v1 object for a surface, which may then be\nused to provide timestamp information for commits.\n\nWarning! The protocol described in this file is currently in the testing\nphase. Backward compatible changes may be added together with the\ncorresponding interface version bump. Backward incompatible changes can\nonly be done by creating a new major version of the extension.",
